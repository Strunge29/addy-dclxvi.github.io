      <description>Introduction This is a post about several bitmap fonts I modify from M+, Tewi, Lemon, &amp;amp; Siji. At first I modify them because I can&amp;rsquo;t find any bitmap font that suitable for my personal preferences.
 I want a small bitmap font that can fit in 6x10 bounding box, but placed inside 6x12 bounding box for extra line spacing. I want extra line spacing for readability reason. I know I can add line spacing in URxvt configuration.</description>

      <description>Introduction According to the Dunst website Dunst is a lightweight replacement for the notification daemons provided by most desktop environments. It’s very customizable, isn’t dependent on any toolkits, and therefore fits into those window manager centric setups we all love to customize to perfection.
When I installed Debian, I start from minimal install. So, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any notification by default. Then I choose Dunst. If you already have other notification daemon and want to try Dunst, Just simply add Dunst to your autostart.</description>
